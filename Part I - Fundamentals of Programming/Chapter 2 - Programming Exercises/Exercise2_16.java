 * Chapter 2 - Exercise 2.16
 * ((Geometry: area of a hexagon) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side
 * of a hexagon and displays its area. The formula for computing the area of a hexagon is
 * 
 * 					Area = ((3âˆš3)/2)* s^2
 *
 * where s is the length of a side. Here is a sample run:
 * Enter the side: 5.5
 * The area of the hexagon is 78.5895
