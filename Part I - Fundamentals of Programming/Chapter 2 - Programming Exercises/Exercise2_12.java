/*
 * Chapter 2 - Exercise 2.12
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 * speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 * take off using the following formula:
 * 
 * 					length = (v^2 / 2a)
 *           
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
 * acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2) and displays the minimum runway
 * length. Here is a sample run:
 *
 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
 * The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
